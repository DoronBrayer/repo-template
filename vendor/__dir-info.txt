The current directory contains third-party libraries that are not available as an npm package.
Perhaps it’ll be a CSS framework, perhaps it’ll be a JavaScript plugin, or perhaps it’ll be a collection of icons. 
Whatever the case, those scripts/assets were NOT created by you (nor by your teammates), hence the name 'vendor'.

Do NOT place npm packages (a.k.a. node modules) in that directory!
npm packages should be placed ONLY in 'node_modules' directory!
